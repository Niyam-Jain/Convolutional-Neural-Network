# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project

This README file provides an overview of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project. In this project, we will build a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs. The project is organized into several sections, including data preprocessing, building the CNN architecture, training the model, and making predictions.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create a CNN model capable of classifying images of cats and dogs. The project consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We perform data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for training. This includes image augmentation and data loading using the Keras `ImageDataGenerator`.

2. **Building the CNN**: We design the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, specifying the layers, filters, activation functions, and more.

3. **Training the CNN**: We compile and train the CNN model using the training dataset. The model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance.

4. **Making Predictions**: After training, we demonstrate how to make predictions on new images using the trained model.

## Getting Started

Before running the code, ensure that you have the required libraries installed, such as `tensorflow` and `keras`. You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The code starts with data preprocessing steps, including image augmentation to improve model generalization and loading the training and test datasets.

2. **Building the CNN**: We define the CNN architecture, including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, flattening, and fully connected layers.

3. **Training the CNN**: The CNN model is compiled with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric. It is then trained on the training data using the `fit` method.

4. **Making Predictions**: The code demonstrates how to make predictions on individual images. It loads a test image, preprocesses it, and predicts whether it contains a cat or a dog.

## Example Predictions

To make predictions on individual images, you can use the following code snippet as an example:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.preprocessing import image

# Load the test image
test_image = image.load_img('dataset/single_prediction/cat_or_dog_1.jpg', target_size=(64, 64))

# Preprocess the image
test_image = image.img_to_array(test_image)
test_image = np.expand_dims(test_image, axis=0)
result = cnn.predict(test_image / 255.0)  # Normalize pixel values

# Determine the class (cat or dog)
if result[0][0] > 0.5:
    prediction = 'dog'
else:
    prediction = 'cat'

print("Prediction:", prediction)
```

## Conclusion

This CNN project showcases how to build, train, and use a Convolutional Neural Network model for image classification tasks. You can further customize the model architecture, fine-tune hyperparameters, and apply it to your own image classification projects.
